We're going to make a very simple 2D side-scroller with an interactive fiction component. For gameplay, we'll have a runner (boat) who moves towards the right of the screen. The player needs to avoid obstacles and pick up buffs for as long as possible. These obstacles can come in three different flavours. Random encounter obstacles will consist the main IF component of the game. They will be triggered by the expiry of a timer or by a hot spot on the map and will determine the outcome of the game as time goes on. Other obstacles will reduce the number of people on the boat and disappear after doing so. Pickups will increase the number of people on the boat. Graphics will be in simple pixel art. To start with we will use cubes and standard particle systems. Sound and music needs to be considered.
